# ShortcutToolbox: Privacy policy
This is privay policy for android app developed by HH-69. The app is available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. 
All data (app preferences created by the you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

## Explanation of permissions requested in the app
The list of permissions required by the app:

| Permission  | Why it is required |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| android.permission.BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE  | Needed for access function such as open power menu, control volume and lock the screen  |
| android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE | Enables the app to create foreground services. Permission automatically granted by the system; can't be revoked by user. |
| android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED | When your device restarts, app will automatic start. If you dont want auto start function, just disable inside app. |
| android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS | Needed to modify system setting.In this app is use to change screen brigthness. |

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
HH-69.
